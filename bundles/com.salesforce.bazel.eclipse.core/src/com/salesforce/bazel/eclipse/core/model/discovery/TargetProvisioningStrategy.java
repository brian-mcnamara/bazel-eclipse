     * will potentially execute Bazel commands to compute the classpath.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This operation is called outside of project provisioning, i.e. implementors can assume that the Eclipse workspace
     * is fully provisioned. Therefore, the computed classpath only represents dependencies of the specified projects
     * (either {@link IClasspathEntry#CPE_LIBRARY} or {@link IClasspathEntry#CPE_PROJECT}). Any source folder is
     * expected to be calculated and setup properly as part of a call to
     * {@link #provisionProjectsForSelectedTargets(Collection, BazelWorkspace, IProgressMonitor)} during project
     * provisioning. Implementors are expected to properly connect dependencies to projects provisioned in the Eclipse
     * workspace, i.e. use {@link IClasspathEntry#CPE_PROJECT} when a dependency exists as target in the workspace.

     * This method is guaranteed to be called within {@link IWorkspaceRoot a workspace level lock} and allowed to modify
     * workspace resources. Implementors should therefore not schedule any conflicting background jobs/threads which may
     * want to obtain resource level locking. This is likely going to cause deadlocks.

     * If classpath computation fails implementors are required to fail execution with a {@link CoreException}. If
     * {@link CoreException#getStatus() the exception status} is {@link IStatus#isMultiStatus() a multi-status} then the
